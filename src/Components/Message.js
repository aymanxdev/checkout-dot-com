        <p>Thank you Checkout.Com</p>
        <h2>
          Thank you so much for inviting me to the online coding test. Although
          the test was limited to show my ability to build creative things, I
          believe I can do much more than that if given the opportunity. Since
          years ago when I had a Shopify store and dealt with payment gateways,
          it's been a dream to work for a company like Checkout.Com. An
          opportunity to work at Checkout.Com as a junior engineer or an intern
          would help me prove myself and what I could achieve for the company in
          the long run. Please let me know if thereâ€™s anything else I should
          provide to move the process forward. Thank you ðŸ˜Š
        </h2>
